## Key Features Implementation

### State Management
The app uses Zustand with AsyncStorage for persistent state:
- **User Store**: Language, theme, Study Pal config, notifications
- **Task Store**: All tasks with CRUD operations and filtering
- **Stats Store**: Achievements, streaks, study time tracking
- **Group Store**: Future collaboration features

### Multi-language Support
All UI text is translated through the `useTranslation` hook. Currently supports:
- English (en)
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Chinese (zh)
- Japanese (ja)
- Arabic (ar)

To add a new language, update `src/utils/translations.ts`.

### AI Integration
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4 for chat and grammar checking
- System prompts customized for each mode
- Responds in user's selected language
- Error handling with fallback messages

### Animations
Study Pal mascots use React Native Reanimated for smooth animations:
- Timing-based animations with easing
- Looping sequences for continuous movement
- Can be toggled on/off in settings

## Customization

### Adding New Animals
1. Add the animal type to `StudyPalAnimal` in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Add emoji and translation in `src/utils/translations.ts`
3. Add animation logic in `src/components/StudyPal.tsx`

### Adding New Theme Colors
1. Add color to `ThemeColor` type in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Add gradient colors to theme arrays in screens
3. Update translation keys if needed

### Adding New Languages
1. Add language code to `Language` type
2. Add full translation object in `src/utils/translations.ts`
3. Add quotes and tips in that language in `src/utils/content.ts`

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Groups & Collaboration**: Student and teacher group features
- **Calendar Integration**: Sync with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar
- **Push Notifications**: Task reminders with custom alarm sounds
- **Mindfulness Breaks**: Classical music player and guided breathing
- **Resource Library**: Video and article suggestions from AI
- **Offline Mode**: Full functionality without internet
- **Data Export**: Export tasks and stats to CSV/PDF
- **Widgets**: Home screen widgets for quick task view

## Development Notes

### Environment Variables
API keys are pre-configured in the Vibecode environment:
- `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_VIBECODE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_VIBECODE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### Best Practices
- Use double quotes for strings with apostrophes
- Avoid alerts; use custom modals instead
- All user-facing text should use `t()` translation function
- Use Pressable instead of TouchableOpacity
- Dismiss keyboard on scroll/tap outside input

### Performance
- Individual Zustand selectors to avoid re-renders
- Memoized calculations for progress bars
- Optimized FlatList/ScrollView rendering
- AsyncStorage for fast local data persistence
