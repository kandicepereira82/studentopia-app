- ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIX: Cross-User Data Isolation** - Fixed major security/privacy bug where new users could see previous users' tasks. Implemented proper user data isolation: (1) Tasks now filtered by userId in all screens, (2) Logout properly clears all user-specific data (tasks, stats, groups), (3) Task store methods now accept optional userId parameter for filtering, (4) Each user's data is completely isolated from others.

## Key Features Implementation

### State Management
The app uses Zustand with AsyncStorage for persistent state:
- **User Store**: Language, theme, Study Pal config, notifications
- **Task Store**: All tasks with CRUD operations and filtering
- **Stats Store**: Achievements, streaks, study time tracking
- **Timer Store**: Centralized timer state with synchronized intervals
- **Group Store**: Group creation, joining, search, and management

### Multi-language Support
All UI text is translated through the `useTranslation` hook. Currently supports:
- English (en)
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Chinese (zh)
- Japanese (ja)
- Arabic (ar)

To add a new language, update `src/utils/translations.ts`.

### AI Integration
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4 for chat and grammar checking
- System prompts customized for each mode
- Responds in user's selected language
- Error handling with fallback messages

### Animations
Study Pal mascots use React Native Reanimated for smooth animations:
- Timing-based animations with easing
- Looping sequences for continuous movement
- Can be toggled on/off in settings

## Customization

### Adding New Animals
1. Add the animal type to `StudyPalAnimal` in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Add emoji and translation in `src/utils/translations.ts`
3. Add animation logic in `src/components/StudyPal.tsx`

### Adding New Theme Colors
1. Add color to `ThemeColor` type in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Add gradient colors to theme arrays in screens
3. Update translation keys if needed

### Adding New Languages
1. Add language code to `Language` type
2. Add full translation object in `src/utils/translations.ts`
3. Add quotes and tips in that language in `src/utils/content.ts`

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Enhanced Group Features**: Group chat, member management, and teacher assignment features
- **Push Notifications**: Task reminders with custom alarm sounds
- **Mindfulness Breaks**: Guided breathing exercises and meditation timer
- **Resource Library**: Video and article suggestions from AI
- **Offline Mode**: Full functionality without internet
- **Data Export**: Export tasks and stats to CSV/PDF
- **Widgets**: Home screen widgets for quick task view
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark theme support (partial implementation)
- **Voice Commands**: Add tasks and control timer with voice
- **Study Analytics**: Detailed charts showing productivity patterns

## Development Notes

### Environment Variables
API keys are pre-configured in the Vibecode environment:
- `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_VIBECODE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_VIBECODE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### Best Practices
- Use double quotes for strings with apostrophes
- Avoid native alerts; use CustomAlert component instead
- All user-facing text should use `t()` translation function
- Use Pressable instead of TouchableOpacity
- Dismiss keyboard on scroll/tap outside input
- Use individual Zustand selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Performance
- Individual Zustand selectors to avoid re-renders
- Memoized calculations for progress bars
- Optimized FlatList/ScrollView rendering
- AsyncStorage for fast local data persistence

## Troubleshooting

### Blank Screens Issue
If you see blank/white screens on tabs:
1. **Close and reopen the app** - The app will automatically detect invalid user data and show onboarding
2. **Check the Profile tab** - If visible, look for the "Set Up Profile" button
3. **View logs** - Check the LOGS tab in Vibecode or `expo.log` file for debug information

**See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed solutions.**

### Settings Not Visible
Settings is not a separate tab - it's a modal:
1. Go to **Profile** tab
2. Tap the **gear icon (⚙️)** in the top-right corner
3. Settings modal opens with notification and calendar options

### Common Issues
- **App shows onboarding repeatedly**: User data not saving - check AsyncStorage permissions
- **Some translations missing**: Check `src/utils/translations.ts` for the key
- **Study Pal not animating**: Toggle animations in Profile → Study Pal section
- **Music not playing**: Check device volume and audio permissions

## Getting Started

The app runs automatically on Expo. No additional setup required.

## User Flow

1. **Onboarding**: Set username, name Study Pal, choose animal and theme
2. **Home**: View daily progress, motivational quote, and study tip
3. **Tasks**: Add and manage tasks with categories and due dates
4. **Calendar**: Visualize tasks on calendar, tap to view by date
5. **Timer**: Run study sessions with customizable durations and background music
6. **AI Helper**: Ask questions or check grammar
7. **Profile**: Customize settings and manage preferences
